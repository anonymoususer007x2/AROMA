"A small business that makes custom furniture has been growing steadily. In the first year, they made $50,000 in revenue. The second year, their revenue increased by 20%. In the third year, their revenue was 1.5 times the revenue of the second year. If this trend continues, with revenue increasing by 50% in the fourth year compared to the third year, what will be their total revenue over the four years?","In the first year, the revenue was $50,000.
In the second year, the revenue increased by 20%: $50,000 * 1.2 = <<50000*1.2=60000>>$60,000.
In the third year, the revenue was 1.5 times the second year: $60,000 * 1.5 = <<60000*1.5=90000>>$90,000.
In the fourth year, the revenue increased by 50% compared to the third year: $90,000 * 1.5 = <<90000*1.5=135000>>$135,000.
The total revenue over the four years is: $50,000 + $60,000 + $90,000 + $135,000 = <<50000+60000+90000+135000=335000>>$335,000.

"A small town's population is growing at a rate of 5% per year. If the town currently has 12,000 residents, approximately how many residents will the town have after 3 years of growth at this rate?","To calculate the population after 3 years, we need to increase the current population by 5% each year.

After 1 year: 12,000 * 1.05 = <<12000*1.05=12600>>12,600 residents
After 2 years: 12,600 * 1.05 = <<12600*1.05=13230>>13,230 residents
After 3 years: 13,230 * 1.05 = <<13230*1.05=13892>>13,892 residents (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Therefore, after 3 years of growth at a rate of 5% per year, the town will have approximately 13,892 residents.

"A pond of lilypads doubles in size every week. If the pond started with just 5 lilypads, and it took 7 weeks for the entire pond to be covered, how many lilypads were there in the pond at the start of the 5th week?","We know it took 7 weeks to cover the pond, so let's work backwards from there.
At the end of the 7th week, the pond was completely covered.
At the start of the 7th week, the pond was half covered.
At the start of the 6th week, the pond was a quarter covered.
At the start of the 5th week, the pond was an eighth covered.
Since we started with 5 lilypads and it doubled each week, at the start of the 5th week there would be 5 * 2^4 = 5 * 16 = <<5*16=80>>80 lilypads.

A bacteria culture starts with 500 cells and doubles in size every 30 minutes. How many bacteria cells will be present after 3 hours?,"The bacteria culture doubles every 30 minutes, which means it will double 6 times in 3 hours (since there are 6 30-minute periods in 3 hours).
Start: 500
After 30 min: 500 * 2 = <<500*2=1000>>1000

After the first month:
Sold: 20% of 500 = 0.2 * 500 = <<0.2*500=100>>100 units
Remaining: 500 - 100 = <<500-100=400>>400 units
Restock: 400 + 100 = <<400+100=500>>500 units
After the second month:

Assuming this growth rate remains constant, how tall will the bamboo plant be after 3 weeks (21 days)?","To calculate the height after 21 days, we need to multiply the initial height by the growth factor (1 + growth rate) raised to the power of the number of days.

The initial height is 2 feet.
After 21 days, the height will be: 2 * 1.2^21 = <<2*1.2^21=76.20>>76.20 feet (rounded to 76 feet)

"A family decides to start saving for their daughter's college education. They start with an initial investment of $5,000 and plan to contribute an additional $2,000 every year. Assuming an annual compound interest rate of 6%, how much money will they have saved after 10 years?","Let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Initial investment = $5,000
2. Annual contribution = $2,000
3. Annual interest rate = 6% or 0.06
4. Number of years = 10

To calculate the total amount after 10 years, we can use the future value formula for an annuity:
FV = P * [(1+r)^n - 1] / r + A * [((1+r)^n - 1) / r]

Where:
FV = Future Value
P = Initial investment
r = Annual interest rate
n = Number of years
A = Annual contribution

Plugging in the values:
FV = 5000 * [(1+0.06)^10 - 1] / 0.06 + 2000 * [((1+0.06)^10 - 1) / 0.06]

First, let's calculate (1+0.06)^10:
(1+0.06)^10 = <<1.06^10=1.7908477953>>1.7908477953

Now, let's calculate the two parts of the equation:
Part 1: 5000 * [(1.7908477953 - 1) / 0.06] = <<5000*((1.7908477953-1)/0.06)=65846.9658833333>>65846.9658833333
Part 2: 2000 * [((1.7908477953 - 1) / 0.06] = <<2000*((1.7908477953-1)/0.06)=26338.7863533333>>26338.7863533333

Adding the two parts together:
65846.9658833333 + 26338.7863533333 = <<65846.9658833333+26338.7863533333=92185.7522366667>>92185.7522366667

If the cone has a 6-inch diameter base, what is the height of the cone? (Use 3.14 for pi and round your answer to the nearest whole number.)","The formula for the volume of a cylinder is pi * r^2 * h, where r is the radius and h is the height.
The radius of the cylinder is 3 inches / 2 = <<3/2=1.5>>1.5 inches
Substituting the values, the volume of the clay cylinder is 3.14 * 1.5^2 * 10 = <<3.14*1.5^2*10=70.65>>70.65 cubic inches
The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3) * pi * r^2 * h
The radius of the cone's base is 6 inches / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 inches
Since the volume of the clay remains the same, we can set up an equation:
70.65 = (1/3) * 3.14 * 3^2 * h
Solving for h:
70.65 = (1/3) * 3.14 * 9 * h
70.65 = 28.26 * (1/3) * h

How many boxes of cereal does the store have left after the sale?","Initially, the store has 120 boxes of cereal.
After the supplier's delivery, the inventory triples, so the new total is 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 boxes.

360 / 2 = <<360/2=180>>180 boxes sold during the sale.
To find the remaining boxes, we subtract the number of boxes sold from the total inventory:
360 - 180 = <<360-180=180>>180 boxes of cereal remain after the sale.

"A small business has 5 employees and expects to grow by 20% each year for the next 4 years. Assuming they always round down when calculating 20% of their current number of employees to determine how many to hire, how many employees will they have after 4 years?","In the first year they grow by 20%: 5 * 0.2 = <<5*0.2=1.0>>1, so they hire 1 employee for a total of 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 employees.
In the second year, with 6 employees, they again grow by 20%: 6 * 0.2 = <<6*0.2=1.2>>1, so they hire 1 more for a total of 6 + 1 = <<6+1=7>>7 employees.  
In the third year, with 7 employees, 20% growth means: 7 * 0.2 = <<7*0.2=1.4>>1, so they again hire 1 more for a total of 7 + 1 = <<7+1=8>>8 employees.
In the fourth year, with 8 employees, 20% growth calculates as: 8 * 0.2 = <<8*0.2=1.6>>1, so they hire 1 final employee.
After 4 years of 20% growth, rounding down, the small business will have grown from 5 employees to 8 + 1 = <<8+1=9>>9 employees.

Assuming this growth rate remains constant, what will the population of the village be after 10 years?","The population grows by 5% each year, which means it gets multiplied by 1.05 each year.

After 2 years, the population will be 1260 * 1.05 = <<1260*1.05=1323>>1323

"A grape vine grows at a steady rate, increasing in length by about 12 inches per week during the growing season. If a grape vine is 4 feet long at the beginning of the season and the season lasts for 16 weeks, approximately how long will the grape vine be at the end of the season?","The grape vine grows 12 inches per week, which is equivalent to 1 foot per week since 12 inches = 1 foot.
Over the 16-week season, the grape vine will grow an additional 16 feet since 1 foot/week * 16 weeks = <<1*16=16>>16 feet.
At the beginning of the season, the grape vine was already 4 feet long.

24 hours / 4 hours per doubling = <<24/4=6>>6 doublings
To find the bacteria population after 6 doublings, start with 1000 and double it 6 times:

$10,000 * (1 + 0.20)^5 = $10,000 * 1.2^5 = $10,000 * <<1.2^5=2.48832>>2.48832 = <<10000*2.48832=24883.20>>$24,883.20

Then, add the additional investment of $5,000:
$24,883.20 + $5,000 = <<24883.20+5000=29883.20>>$29,883.20

Now, calculate the value of the business after 3 more years of growth at 20% annually:
$29,883.20 * (1 + 0.20)^3 = $29,883.20 * 1.2^3 = $29,883.20 * <<1.2^3=1.728>>1.728 = <<29883.20*1.728=51638.1696>>$51,638.17

20% of 50 is 0.2 * 50 = <<0.2*50=10>>10 bars.

Month 2: They now have 60 bars, and again produce 20% more.
20% of 60 is 0.2 * 60 = <<0.2*60=12>>12 bars.

Month 3: They now have 72 bars, and again produce 20% more.
20% of 72 is 0.2 * 72 = <<0.2*72=14.4>>14 bars (rounded down).
