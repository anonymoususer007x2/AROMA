Question,Answer
Maya is 12 years younger than her brother Liam. Liam will be 32 years old in 6 years. What will be the combined age of Maya and Liam in 8 years?,"Liam will be 32 years old in 6 years, so his current age is 32 - 6 = <<32-6=26>>26 years old.
Maya is 12 years younger than Liam, so her current age is 26 - 12 = <<26-12=14>>14 years old.
In 8 years, Liam will be 26 + 8 = <<26+8=34>>34 years old.
In 8 years, Maya will be 14 + 8 = <<14+8=22>>22 years old.
The combined age of Maya and Liam in 8 years will be 34 + 22 = <<34+22=56>>56 years old.

"Jack's grandfather is 84 years old, which is 6 times as old as Jack will be in 5 years. Jack's father is half the age of Jack's grandfather. How old is Jack's father now?","Let's start by finding Jack's age in 5 years. We know that will be 1/6 of his grandfather's current age.
Grandfather's age / 6 = Jack's age in 5 years
84 / 6 = <<84/6=14>>14
So in 5 years, Jack will be 14 years old. That means Jack is currently 14 - 5 = <<14-5=9>>9 years old.
Now, we know that Jack's father is half the age of Jack's grandfather.
Grandfather's age / 2 = Father's age
84 / 2 = <<84/2=42>>42
Therefore, Jack's father is 42 years old now.

"Maya is currently 12 years old, and her mother is 32. Maya's grandfather is 4 times older than Maya's mother. In how many years will Maya's grandfather be twice as old as Maya and her mother combined?","Maya's mother is currently 32 years old.
Maya's grandfather is 32 * 4 = <<32*4=128>>128 years old.
In x years, Maya will be 12 + x years old and her mother will be 32 + x years old.
Maya's grandfather will be twice as old as Maya and her mother combined when:
128 + x = 2(12 + x + 32 + x)
128 + x = 2(44 + 2x)
128 + x = 88 + 4x
3x = 40
x = <<40/3=13.333333333333334>>13 (rounded to nearest whole number)
Maya's grandfather will be twice as old as Maya and her mother combined in 13 years.

"Theo is 12 years younger than his sister Anna. In 5 years, Anna will be twice as old as Theo. How old is Theo now?","Let's say Theo is x years old now. Then his sister Anna is x + 12 years old now.
In 5 years, Theo will be x + 5 years old and Anna will be x + 12 + 5 = x + 17 years old.
We know that in 5 years, Anna will be twice as old as Theo. So, x + 17 = 2(x + 5)
x + 17 = 2x + 10
17 = x + 10
x = <<17-10=7>>7
So, Theo is 7 years old now.

"Three years ago, John was 4 times as old as his daughter Mary. In 6 years, John will be 2 times as old as Mary. How old is John now?","Let's say Mary is x years old now. Then, John would be 4x+3 years old now.
In 6 years, Mary would be x+6 years old, and John would be 4x+9 years old.
According to the question, in 6 years, John will be 2 times as old as Mary.
So, 4x+9 = 2(x+6)
4x+9 = 2x+12
2x = 3
x = <<3/2=1.5>>1.5
Since x represents Mary's current age and it needs to be a whole number, we round 1.5 to 2.
If Mary is 2 years old now, then John is currently 4*2+3 = <<4*2+3=11>>11 years old.

"Julia is 32 years old and her daughter Sophie is 5 years old. Julia's mother, Grace, is 28 years older than Julia. In how many years will Grace's age be twice the combined ages of Julia and Sophie?","Currently, Julia is 32 years old and Sophie is 5 years old.
Their combined ages are 32 + 5 = <<32+5=37>>37 years old.
Grace is 28 years older than Julia, so Grace is currently 32 + 28 = <<32+28=60>>60 years old.
In x years, Julia will be 32 + x years old, and Sophie will be 5 + x years old.
Their combined ages in x years will be (32 + x) + (5 + x) = 37 + 2x years old.
Grace's age in x years will be 60 + x years old.
To find when Grace's age will be twice the combined ages of Julia and Sophie, we set up the equation:
60 + x = 2(37 + 2x)
60 + x = 74 + 4x
-3x = 14
x = <<14/-3=-4.67>>-4.67, which rounds to <<round(-4.67)=-5>>-5
Since x is negative, this means that Grace's age was twice the combined ages of Julia and Sophie 5 years ago.

"Jesse is 12 years younger than his brother Mark. In 6 years, Mark will be twice as old as Jesse is now. How old will Jesse be in 10 years?","Let J be Jesse's current age and M be Mark's current age.
Mark is 12 years older than Jesse, so M = J + 12.
In 6 years, Mark will be twice Jesse's current age. So M + 6 = 2J
Substitute M with J + 12:
J + 12 + 6 = 2J
J + 18 = 2J
18 = J
Jesse is currently 18 years old.
In 10 years, Jesse will be 18 + 10 = <<18+10=28>>28 years old.

"Maya is 12 years younger than her brother Tim. Four years ago, Tim was twice as old as Maya. How old will Maya be in 7 years?","Let's say Maya's current age is x. Then, Tim's current age is x + 12.
Four years ago, Maya was x - 4 years old, and Tim was x + 12 - 4 = x + 8 years old.
According to the question, four years ago, Tim was twice as old as Maya:
x + 8 = 2(x - 4)
x + 8 = 2x - 8
8 = x
So Maya's current age is 8 years old.
In 7 years, Maya will be 8 + 7 = <<8+7=15>>15 years old.

Lisa is 32 years old and her daughter Emma is 4 years old. In how many years will Lisa be twice as old as Emma?,"Let's call the number of years from now 'x'.
In 'x' years, Lisa's age will be 32 + x.
In 'x' years, Emma's age will be 4 + x.
We need to solve the equation: 32 + x = 2(4 + x)
32 + x = 8 + 2x
32 - 8 = 2x - x
24 = x
Therefore, in 24 years, Lisa will be twice as old as Emma.

"Liam is 12 years younger than his sister Emma. Liam is also 3 years older than his brother Noah. In 5 years, what will be the sum of all their ages if Emma is currently 19 years old?","Emma is currently 19 years old. In 5 years, she will be 19 + 5 = <<19+5=24>>24 years old.
Liam is 12 years younger than Emma, so he is currently 19 - 12 = <<19-12=7>>7 years old.
In 5 years, Liam will be 7 + 5 = <<7+5=12>>12 years old. 
Noah is 3 years younger than Liam, so he is currently 7 - 3 = <<7-3=4>>4 years old.
In 5 years, Noah will be 4 + 5 = <<4+5=9>>9 years old.
In 5 years, the sum of all their ages will be 24 + 12 + 9 = <<24+12+9=45>>45 years old.

"Ethan is 9 years younger than his sister Sophia. In 5 years, Sophia will be twice as old as Ethan. How old is Ethan now?","Let's say Ethan is x years old now. Then, Sophia is x + 9 years old now.
In 5 years, Ethan will be x + 5 years old, and Sophia will be x + 9 + 5 = x + 14 years old.
We know that in 5 years, Sophia will be twice Ethan's age, so:
x + 14 = 2(x + 5)
x + 14 = 2x + 10
14 = x + 10
x = <<14-10=4>>4
Therefore, Ethan is 4 years old now.

"Jordan is 12 years younger than his sister Samantha. In 6 years, Samantha will be twice as old as Jordan. How old is Samantha now?","Let's say Samantha is x years old now. Then, Jordan is x - 12 years old now.
In 6 years, Samantha will be x + 6 years old and Jordan will be (x - 12) + 6 = x - 6 years old.
We know that in 6 years, Samantha will be twice Jordan's age, so:
x + 6 = 2(x - 6)
x + 6 = 2x - 12
18 = x
Therefore, Samantha is <<18=18>>18 years old now.

"Susie is 4 years younger than her brother Tom. In 6 years, the sum of their ages will be 58. How old is Tom now?","Let's say Tom's current age is x. Then, Susie's current age is x - 4.
In 6 years, Tom will be x + 6 years old, and Susie will be (x - 4) + 6 = x + 2 years old.
We know that the sum of their ages in 6 years will be 58.
(x + 6) + (x + 2) = 58
2x + 8 = 58
2x = 58 - 8
2x = <<58-8=50>>50
x = 50 / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25
Therefore, Tom is 25 years old now.

"Caroline is planning a surprise birthday party for her father. Her father is currently 52 years old and her mother is 4 years younger than him. If Caroline was born when her mother was 26, how old will Caroline be when her father turns 80?","Caroline's father is currently 52 years old, so her mother is 52 - 4 = <<52-4=48>>48 years old.
If Caroline was born when her mother was 26, then Caroline is currently 48 - 26 = <<48-26=22>>22 years old.
In 80 - 52 = <<80-52=28>>28 years, Caroline's father will turn 80.

"Zoe is currently 36 years old. Her daughter Lily is one-fourth her age, and her son Ethan is half of Lily's age. In how many years will the sum of Zoe's and her children's ages be 100?","Lily is 36 / 4 = <<36/4=9>>9 years old.
Ethan is half of Lily's age, so 9 / 2 = <<9/2=4.5>>5 years old (rounded to the nearest whole number).
The current sum of their ages is 36 + 9 + 5 = <<36+9+5=50>>50 years old.
To find how many years until the sum of their ages is 100, we calculate 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 years.
In 50 years, the sum of Zoe's and her children's ages will be 100.
#### 50"
"Jane is 32 years old and her daughter Sophie is 4 years old. Jane's mother, Rachel, is 28 years older than Jane. How old will Sophie be when the sum of her age and Rachel's age equals Jane's age?","We know that Jane is 32 years old and Rachel is 28 years older than Jane.
So, Rachel's current age is 32 + 28 = <<32+28=60>>60 years old.
Let's assume Sophie's age when the sum of her age and Rachel's age equals Jane's age is x.
Then, x + (60 + x) = 32 + x
Simplifying, 2x + 60 = 32 + x
Further simplifying, x + 60 = 32
Therefore, x = 32 - 60 = <<32-60=-28>>-28
Since negative age is not possible, we understand that this situation has already happened in the past.
When Jane was 32 - 28 = <<32-28=4>>4 years old, the sum of Sophie's age (which would be 0 as she was just born) and Rachel's age would have been equal to Jane's age.

"Abigail is 12 years younger than her brother Liam. In 6 years, Liam will be twice as old as Abigail. How old is Liam now?","Let's say Liam is L years old now. Then Abigail is L - 12 years old now.
In 6 years, Liam will be L + 6 years old and Abigail will be (L - 12) + 6 = L - 6 years old.
We know that in 6 years, Liam will be twice Abigail's age, so:
L + 6 = 2(L - 6)
L + 6 = 2L - 12
6 = L - 12
L = 6 + 12 = <<6+12=18>>18
So Liam is 18 years old now.

"In the year 2000, Alice was 3 times as old as her son Bob. By 2030, Alice's age will be 10 years less than twice Bob's age. How old will Bob be in 2030?","Let's say Bob was x years old in 2000. Then, Alice would be 3x years old in 2000.
In the 30 years from 2000 to 2030, both Alice and Bob will age by 30 years.
So in 2030, Alice will be 3x + 30 years old, and Bob will be x + 30 years old.
We're told that in 2030, Alice's age will be 10 years less than twice Bob's age.
In equation form: 3x + 30 = 2(x + 30) - 10
Simplifying: 3x + 30 = 2x + 60 - 10
            3x + 30 = 2x + 50
            x = 20
So Bob was 20 in 2000, and will be 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 years old in 2030.

Jacob is 18 years younger than his father. His father is currently 3 times as old as Jacob. How old will Jacob be in 12 years?,"Let's say Jacob is currently x years old.
His father is then x + 18 years old.
We know that his father's age is also 3 times Jacob's age, so:
x + 18 = 3x
18 = 3x - x
18 = 2x
x = 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9
So, Jacob is currently 9 years old.

"When Betty was born, her older brother Doug was 9 years old. In 5 years, Doug will be twice as old as Betty. How old will Betty be when Doug is 30?","Let's solve for Betty's age now. In 5 years, Doug will be 9 + 5 = <<9+5=14>>14 years older than Betty.
If Doug will be twice Betty's age in 5 years, then 14 = 2x where x is Betty's age in 5 years.
Solving, x = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7. So in 5 years Betty will be 7 years old.
Right now, Betty is 7 - 5 = <<7-5=2>>2 years old.
Doug is currently 9 + 2 = <<9+2=11>>11 years old.  
In 30 - 11 = <<30-11=19>>19 years, Doug will be 30.
At that time, Betty will be 2 + 19 = <<2+19=21>>21 years old.

"In 1995, John was 5 times as old as his son Tim. In 2020, John will be 3 times as old as Tim. How old was Tim in 1995?","Let's say Tim was x years old in 1995.
Then John was 5x years old in 1995.
From 1995 to 2020 is a period of 25 years.
So in 2020, Tim will be x + 25 years old.
And in 2020, John will be 5x + 25 years old.
We know that John will be 3 times as old as Tim in 2020.
So, 5x + 25 = 3(x + 25)
5x + 25 = 3x + 75
2x = 50
x = <<50/2=25>>25
Therefore, Tim was 25 years old in 1995.

From 1990 to 2020 is a period of 30 years. So in 2020:
Ava's age = x + 30
Joey's age = 6x + 30
We are told the sum of their ages in 2020 was 102.

So currently, Maria is 2 * 16 = <<2*16=32>>32 years old and her son is 16 years old.
We want to find when Maria will be three times her son's age. Let's say this happens in y years.
Then Maria will be 32 + y years old, and her son will be 16 + y years old.
We can set up the equation: 32 + y = 3(16 + y)
This simplifies to: 32 + y = 48 + 3y
Subtracting 48 from both sides: -16 + y = 3y
Subtracting y from both sides: -16 = 2y

"Lucy is currently 24 years old and her mother, Mary, is 48 years old. In how many years will Lucy be half the age of her mother?","Let's say in x years, Lucy will be half the age of her mother.
Lucy's age in x years: 24 + x
Mary's age in x years: 48 + x
We can set up an equation: 24 + x = (48 + x) / 2
Simplifying the equation: 24 + x = 24 + x/2
Solving for x: x/2 = 0
Therefore, x = <<0*2=0>>0
Lucy is currently half the age of her mother, Mary.

"In the year 2000, Bob was 25 years old and his daughter Alice was 5 years old. In how many years will Bob be twice as old as Alice?","Let's call the number of years from 2000 until Bob is twice Alice's age 'x'.
In the year 2000 + x, Bob will be 25 + x years old and Alice will be 5 + x years old.
For Bob to be twice as old as Alice, we can write the equation: 25 + x = 2(5 + x)
Simplifying: 25 + x = 10 + 2x
Solving for x: 15 = x
Therefore, in 2000 + 15 = <<2000+15=2015>>2015, Bob will be 25 + 15 = <<25+15=40>>40 years old and Alice will be 5 + 15 = <<5+15=20>>20 years old, which is half of Bob's age.

Amy is 5 years younger than that, so 16 - 5 = <<16-5=11>>11 years old.
Eric is 4 years older than Amy, so he is 11 + 4 = <<11+4=15>>15 years old now.
When Janet is 80 years old, it will be 80 - 32 = <<80-32=48>>48 years from now.
At that time, Eric will be 48 years older than he is now.

S + 18 = 2S + 12
18 = S + 12
S = <<18-12=6>>6

Let's assume the desired condition happens after X years.
After X years:
- Mary will be 32 + X years old
- Sophie will be 4 + X years old
- Elizabeth will be 60 + X years old
For Elizabeth's age to be twice the combined age of Mary and Sophie:
60 + X = 2(32 + X + 4 + X)
60 + X = 2(36 + 2X)
60 + X = 72 + 4X

So in 2040, Diego will be x + 40 years old.
And in 2040, Maria will be 5x + 40 years old.
We know that in 2040, Maria will be twice Diego's age.
So, 5x + 40 = 2(x + 40)
5x + 40 = 2x + 80
3x = 40
x = <<40/3=13.333333333333334>>13 (rounded to nearest whole number)

2(x - 16) = x - 4
2x - 32 = x - 4
2x - x = -4 + 32

Albert: 2x - 12 + 5 = 2x - 7
Betty: 2x + 5
Charlie: x + 5
The sum of their ages in 5 years will be 102. So:
(2x - 7) + (2x + 5) + (x + 5) = 102
2x - 7 + 2x + 5 + x + 5 = 102
5x + 3 = 102

Paula's age: 36 + x
Katie's age: 9 + x
Since Paula's age needs to be triple Katie's age, we can set up this equation:
36 + x = 3(9 + x)
36 + x = 27 + 3x
Simplify:
36 - 27 = 3x - x
9 = 2x
Divide both sides by 2:

In 8 years, Maya will be x + 8 years old and Leo will be x + 12 + 8 = x + 20 years old.
We know that in 8 years, Leo will be twice as old as Maya. So, x + 20 = 2(x + 8)
x + 20 = 2x + 16
20 = x + 16
x = <<20-16=4>>4
Therefore, Maya is 4 years old now.

"Megan is 12 years younger than her brother Steve. Four years from now, Steve will be twice as old as Megan was 3 years ago. How old is Megan now?","Let's say Megan is x years old now.
Steve is 12 years older than Megan, so Steve is currently x + 12 years old.
Four years from now, Steve will be x + 12 + 4 = <<x+12+4=x+16>>x + 16 years old.
Three years ago, Megan was x - 3 years old.
The question states that in four years, Steve will be twice Megan's age from 3 years ago.
So, x + 16 = 2(x - 3)
x + 16 = <<2(x-3)=2x-6>>2x - 6
x + 16 - 2x = -6 - 2x
16 - x = -6
16 = -6 + x
x = <<16+6=22>>22
Therefore, Megan is 22 years old now.

"Olivia is 12 years younger than her brother Jacob. In 8 years, Jacob will be twice as old as Olivia. What will be the sum of their ages 5 years from now?","Let's say Jacob is 'J' years old now and Olivia is 'O' years old.
We know Olivia is 12 years younger than Jacob, so O = J - 12.
In 8 years, Jacob will be J + 8, and Olivia will be O + 8 = (J - 12) + 8 = J - 4.
Since Jacob will be twice Olivia's age then, we can write: J + 8 = 2(J - 4)
Solving this: J + 8 = 2J - 8
8 = J - 8
J = <<8+8=16>>16
So, Jacob is 16 now, and Olivia is 16 - 12 = <<16-12=4>>4 now.
In 5 years, Jacob will be 16 + 5 = <<16+5=21>>21 and Olivia will be 4 + 5 = <<4+5=9>>9.
The sum of their ages in 5 years will be 21 + 9 = <<21+9=30>>30.

"John is 24 years old and his daughter Emma is 6 years old. John's father, William, is 30 years older than John. In how many years will William's age be twice the combined age of John and Emma?","John is 24 years old and Emma is 6 years old. Their combined age is 24 + 6 = <<24+6=30>>30 years old.
William is 30 years older than John, so his age is 24 + 30 = <<24+30=54>>54 years old.
Let's assume the number of years it takes is x. 
In x years, William's age will be 54 + x, and the combined age of John and Emma will be 30 + 2x (since there are two of them).
We want to solve the equation: 54 + x = 2(30 + 2x)
54 + x = 60 + 4x
54 - 60 = 4x - x
-6 = 3x
x = -6/3 = <<-6/3=-2>>-2
Since x is negative, it means that William's age was twice the combined age of John and Emma 2 years ago.

How old will Brad be when this happens, and in what year will it occur?","In 2015, Brad was 45 and Emily was 15. Let's say the future year when Brad is twice Emily's age is X years from 2015.
In this future year, Brad will be 45 + X years old, and Emily will be 15 + X years old.
Since Brad is twice as old as Emily, we can write the equation: 45 + X = 2(15 + X)
Solving this equation:
45 + X = 30 + 2X
45 - 30 = 2X - X
15 = X
So, X = <<15/1=15>>15 years from 2015.
In 15 years from 2015, it will be 2015 + 15 = <<2015+15=2030>>2030.

"Liam is 12 years younger than his older sister Emma. When Liam was born, their father John was 32 years old. In how many years will John be twice as old as Emma?","Let's start by defining Emma's current age as E. Since Liam is 12 years younger, his current age is E - 12.
When Liam was born, Emma was 12 years old, so John was 32 + 12 = <<32+12=44>>44 years old when Emma was born.
Currently, John is 44 + E = <<44+E>>44 + E years old.
We want to find how many years from now (let's call it Y) John will be twice Emma's age:
44 + E + Y = 2 * (E + Y)
44 + E + Y = <<2*E+2*Y>>2E + 2Y
44 + E + Y = 2E + 2Y
44 = E + Y
Y = <<44-E>>44 - E

We know that Lucas is 12 years older than Emma, so L = E + 12.
In 7 years, Lucas will be twice as old as Emma's age at that time.
So, L + 7 = 2(E + 7)
Substituting L with E + 12, we get:
E + 12 + 7 = 2(E + 7)
E + 19 = 2E + 14
19 = E + 14
E = 19 - 14
E = <<19-14=5>>5

2040 - 30 = <<2040-30=2010>>2010, so the current year is 2010.
In 2000, Alice was 4 times as old as Bob. 
2010 - 2000 = <<2010-2000=10>>10, so in 2000, Bob was 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 years old.
If Alice was 4 times as old as Bob in 2000, then she was 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 years old in 2000.
To calculate Alice's age in 2050, we add 50 years to her age in 2000.

Bob's current age is 44 in 2023, so in 1995 he was 44 - (2023-1995) = <<44-(2023-1995)=16>>16 years old. 
Since Alice was 3 times as old as Bob in 1995, she was 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old in 1995.
In 2005, 10 years later, Bob was 16 + 10 = <<16+10=26>>26 years old, and Alice was 2 times as old as Bob, so she was 2 * 26 = <<2*26=52>>52 years old in 2005.
From 2005 to 2023 is 2023 - 2005 = <<2023-2005=18>>18 years. So in 2023, Alice is 52 + 18 = <<52+18=70>>70 years old.
From 2023 to 2028 is 2028 - 2023 = <<2028-2023=5>>5 years.

In year Y, Emma's age = 4 + (Y - 2020) = <<4+(Y-2020)=Y-2016>>Y - 2016
Since John is twice Emma's age in year Y:

x = <<12-8=4>>4
So, Olivia is currently 4 years old, and Noah is 4 + 8 = <<4+8=12>>12 years old.
For Noah to be three times Olivia's age, Olivia would need to be 12 years old (since 12 * 3 = 36).
Olivia will be 12 when another 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 years have passed.
Since their father is currently 42, in 8 years, he will be 42 + 8 = <<42+8=50>>50 years old.

"Oliver is 12 years younger than his sister Emma. Emma is half the age of their mother. In 10 years, the sum of all of their ages will be 100. How old is their mother now?","Let's say Emma is x years old now. Then Oliver is x - 12 years old.
Their mother is 2x years old since Emma is half her age.
In 10 years, Emma will be x + 10, Oliver will be x - 2, and their mother will be 2x + 10.
So, (x + 10) + (x - 2) + (2x + 10) = 100
4x + 18 = <<4*x+18=100>>100
4x = <<100-18=82>>82
x = <<82/4=20.5>>20.5, rounded to <<round(20.5)=21>>21
Since x represents Emma's current age and their mother is twice Emma's age, their mother is currently 21 * 2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.

"Maya is 12 years younger than her sister Lila. In 8 years, Lila will be twice as old as Maya. How old is Maya now?","Let's say Maya is x years old now. Then Lila is x + 12 years old now.
In 8 years, Maya will be x + 8 years old and Lila will be x + 12 + 8 = x + 20 years old.
We know that in 8 years, Lila will be twice as old as Maya. So:
x + 20 = 2(x + 8)
x + 20 = 2x + 16
20 = x + 16
x = 20 - 16
x = <<20-16=4>>4
So Maya is 4 years old now.

"John is 12 years younger than his sister Kate, who is half the age of their father. If their father is 60 years old now, how old will John be when Kate turns 42?","If their father is 60 years old, then Kate is 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 years old now.
Since John is 12 years younger than Kate, he is currently 30 - 12 = <<30-12=18>>18 years old.
In 42 - 30 = <<42-30=12>>12 years, Kate will turn 42.
At that time, John will be 18 + 12 = <<18+12=30>>30 years old.

At that time, Karen was 3 * 14 = <<3*14=42>>42 years old.
Karen was 52 - 42 = <<52-42=10>>10 years older than 3 times Lucy's age 10 years ago.
Let's say in n years, Karen will be 2 times Lucy's age.
Karen's age in n years = 52 + n
Lucy's age in n years = 24 + n
52 + n = 2(24 + n)
52 + n = 48 + 2n
4 = n
Therefore, in 4 years, Karen will be 2 times Lucy's age.
In 4 years, Lucy will be 24 + 4 = <<24+4=28>>28 years old.

The question states their current combined age is 44, so there must be a fourth cousin.
Let's call the fourth cousin Anna, and her current age would be 44 - 36 = <<44-36=8>>8 years old.
In the future, when their combined age is 68, it will be 68 - 44 = <<68-44=24>>24 years later.

"Sophie is currently 36 years old and her daughter Emma is 9. Sophie's mother, Olivia, is 28 years older than Sophie. In how many years will Olivia's age be twice the combined age of Sophie and Emma?","In n years:
Olivia's age = 28 + 36 + n = <<28+36=64>>64 + n
Sophie's age = 36 + n
Emma's age = 9 + n
We want Olivia's age to be twice the combined age of Sophie and Emma:
64 + n = 2(36 + n + 9 + n)
64 + n = 2(45 + 2n)
64 + n = <<2*45=90>>90 + 4n
n - 4n = 90 - 64
-3n = <<90-64=26>>26
n = <<26/-3=-8.666666666666666>>-8.666666666666666
Rounded to the nearest whole number, n = <<round(-8.666666666666666)=-9>>-9

To determine when Grandma Ella's age will be double of Sophie's age, we can use the equation:
75 + x = 2(15 + x), where x is the number of years.
75 + x = 30 + 2x
45 + x = 2x
45 = x
Therefore, in 45 years, Grandma Ella's age will be double of Sophie's age.

The current sum of their ages is 30 + 5 + 2 = <<30+5+2=37>>37 years.
To find how many years until the sum of their ages is 100, we calculate 100 - 37 = <<100-37=63>>63 years.
In 63 years, Juan will be 30 + 63 = <<30+63=93>>93 years old.
Sofia will be 5 + 63 = <<5+63=68>>68 years old.
Diego will be 2 + 63 = <<2+63=65>>65 years old.

"Emily is 12 years younger than her brother Adam. In 6 years, Adam will be twice as old as Emily. How old will Emily be in 10 years?","Let's say Emily is E years old now and Adam is A years old now.
We know Emily is 12 years younger than Adam, so A = E + 12.
In 6 years, Adam will be twice as old as Emily.
This means A + 6 = 2(E + 6)
Substituting A with E + 12, we get:
(E + 12) + 6 = 2(E + 6)
E + 18 = 2E + 12
18 = E + 12
E = <<18-12=6>>6
So, Emily is 6 years old now.
In 10 years, Emily will be 6 + 10 = <<6+10=16>>16 years old.

Then the mother would be 80 - x years old in 2010.
We are told the mother's age is 5 times the square of the daughter's age.
So, 80 - x = 5x^2
80 = 5x^2 + x
Solving the equation:
5x^2 + x - 80 = 0
(5x - 16)(x + 5) = 0
x = 16/5 or x = -5 (but negative age is not possible)
So the daughter was 16/5 = <<16/5=3.2>>3 years old (rounded to nearest whole number).
The mother was 80 - 3 = <<80-3=77>>77 years old in 2010.

55 + X = 2(35 + 2X)
55 + X = <<2*35=70>>70 + <<2*2=4>>4X
X = 70 + 4X - 55
X = <<70-55=15>>15 + 4X

x = 15/2 = <<15/2=7.5>>7.5, rounded to <<round(7.5)=8>>8
So Liam is currently 8 years old.
Since Liam is 12 years younger than Emma, Emma's current age is 8 + 12 = <<8+12=20>>20 years old.
The sum of their current ages is 8 + 20 = <<8+20=28>>28 years old.

Tim is 4 times younger than Sarah was three years ago. So if Sarah was x - 3, then Tim was (x - 3) / 4.
Three years from now, Sarah will be x + 3, and Tim will be ((x - 3) / 4) + 3.
We know that the sum of their ages in three years will be 42.
So, (x + 3) + (((x - 3) / 4) + 3) = 42
Simplifying: x + 3 + (x - 3) / 4 + 3 = 42
             x + 3 + x/4 - 3/4 + 3 = 42
             x + x/4 + 6 - 3/4 = 42

In 6 years, Ethan will be x + 6 years old, and Lucas will be x + 12 + 6 = x + 18 years old.
We know that in 6 years, Lucas will be twice Ethan's age, so:
x + 18 = 2(x + 6)
x + 18 = 2x + 12
18 = x + 12
6 = x
So Ethan is currently 6 years old.
In 10 years, Ethan will be 6 + 10 = <<6+10=16>>16 years old.

"John is 12 years younger than his brother Mike. In 6 years, Mike will be twice as old as John. How old will John be in 10 years?","Let's say John is x years old now. Then Mike is x + 12 years old now.
In 6 years, John will be x + 6 years old and Mike will be x + 12 + 6 = x + 18 years old.
We know that in 6 years, Mike will be twice as old as John. So, x + 18 = 2(x + 6)
x + 18 = 2x + 12
18 = x + 12
x = <<18-12=6>>6
So John is 6 years old now.
In 10 years, John will be 6 + 10 = <<6+10=16>>16 years old.

"Billy is 12 years younger than his sister Amy. In 5 years, Amy will be twice as old as Billy. How old will Billy be in 10 years?","Let's say Billy is x years old now. Then Amy is x + 12 years old now.
In 5 years, Billy will be x + 5 years old and Amy will be x + 12 + 5 = x + 17 years old.
We know that in 5 years, Amy will be twice Billy's age, so:
x + 17 = 2(x + 5)
x + 17 = 2x + 10
17 = x + 10
x = <<17-10=7>>7
So Billy is 7 years old now. In 10 years, he will be 7 + 10 = <<7+10=17>>17 years old.

"Emma is 8 years younger than her brother Lucas. When Emma was born, their grandfather was 62 years old. By the time Emma is 3 times as old as she is now, their grandfather will be 100 years old. How old is Lucas now?","Let's say Emma is x years old now.
When Emma was born, Lucas was x + 8 years old.
Grandfather was 62 years old when Emma was born, and he'll be 100 when Emma is 3x years old.
This means it will take 100 - 62 = <<100-62=38>>38 years for Emma's age to triple.
If x is Emma's current age, then 3x - x = 38. Simplifying, 2x = 38.
Solving for x, we get x = 38 / 2 = <<38/2=19>>19. So Emma is currently 19 years old.
Since Lucas is 8 years older than Emma, Lucas is currently 19 + 8 = <<19+8=27>>27 years old.

"Sophie is 32 years old, and her daughter Emma is 8. Sophie's mother, Grandma Lily, is 40 years older than Sophie. In how many years will Grandma Lily's age be twice the combined age of Sophie and Emma?","Currently, Sophie is 32 years old, Emma is 8 years old, and Grandma Lily is 32 + 40 = <<32+40=72>>72 years old.
Let's say in n years, Grandma Lily's age will be twice the combined age of Sophie and Emma.
After n years:
Grandma Lily's age = 72 + n
Sophie's age = 32 + n
Emma's age = 8 + n
According to the given condition:
72 + n = 2(32 + n + 8 + n)
72 + n = 2(40 + 2n)
72 + n = 80 + 4n
4n - n = 80 - 72
3n = <<80-72=8>>8
n = <<8/3=2.67>>2.67, rounding to the nearest whole number, n = <<round(2.67)=3>>3
Therefore, in 3 years, Grandma Lily's age will be twice the combined age of Sophie and Emma.

Amelia is 32 years old and her daughter Bella is 8 years old. In how many years will Amelia be exactly twice the age of Bella?,"Let's call the number of years from now 'x'.
In 'x' years, Amelia's age will be 32 + x.
In 'x' years, Bella's age will be 8 + x.
We want Amelia's age to be twice Bella's age, so we can write the equation:
32 + x = 2(8 + x)
32 + x = 16 + 2x
32 - 16 = 2x - x
<<32-16=16>>16 = x
Therefore, in 16 years, Amelia will be twice the age of Bella.

In 8 years, Olivia will be x + 8 years old, and Eric will be x + 12 + 8 = x + 20 years old.
We know that in 8 years, Olivia will be 2/3 of Eric's age, so:
(x + 8) = 2/3 * (x + 20)
x + 8 = 2/3x + 40/3
x + 8 = 2/3x + <<40/3=13.33>>13 (rounded down)
x + 8 = 2/3x + 13
x - 2/3x = 13 - 8
1/3x = <<13-8=5>>5

Mary: x + 5
John: (x - 12) + 5 = x - 7
Mark: 2x + 5
The sum of their ages in 5 years will be 114. So:

Three years ago, Jenny was j-3 years old and Tom was t-3 years old.
We know Jenny was twice as old as Tom 3 years ago, so j-3 = 2(t-3)
Simplifying, j-3 = 2t-6
              j = 2t-3
We are also told that Tom is 12 years younger than Jenny, so j = t+12
Equating the two expressions for j: 2t-3 = t+12

Since negative age doesn't make sense, Noah must have been born in 2022, making him 0 years old in 2020.
If Liam was 5 times as old as Noah in 2020, then Liam was 5 * 0 = <<5*0=0>>0 years old in 2020. However, this also doesn't make sense, so let's calculate Liam's age another way.
Since Noah will be 18 in 2040, Liam will be 5 * 18 = <<5*18=90>>90 years old in 2040.
To find Liam's age in 2055, we take his age in 2040 (90) and add 15 years (the difference between 2055 and 2040).

"Olivia is 4 years younger than her brother Charlie. In 6 years, Olivia will be 2/3 of Charlie's age. How old will Charlie be in 10 years?","Let Olivia's current age be x. Then, Charlie's current age is x + 4.
In 6 years, Olivia will be x + 6 and Charlie will be x + 4 + 6 = x + 10.
We know that in 6 years, Olivia will be 2/3 of Charlie's age.
So, (x + 6) = 2/3 * (x + 10)
x + 6 = 2/3x + 20/3
x + 6 = 2/3x + 6 2/3
x - 2/3x = 6 2/3 - 6
x/3 = 2/3
x = <<2/3*3=2>>2
So Olivia is currently 2 years old, and Charlie is 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 years old.
In 10 years, Charlie will be 6 + 10 = <<6+10=16>>16 years old.

"In 1995, Jack was 3 times as old as Diane. If the sum of their ages in 2020 is 110, how old was Diane in 1995?","Let's say Diane was x years old in 1995. 
Then in 1995, Jack would be 3x years old.
From 1995 to 2020 is a period of 25 years.
So in 2020, Diane would be x + 25 years old, and Jack would be 3x + 25 years old.
We're told the sum of their ages in 2020 is 110.
(x + 25) + (3x + 25) = 110
4x + 50 = 110
4x = 110 - 50
4x = 60
x = 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15
Therefore, Diane was 15 years old in 1995.

Then, John's age at that time would be 3x.
We know that the difference between John and Emily's age is always 30 - 5 = <<30-5=25>>25 years.
So, 3x - x = <<3*x-x=2*x>>2x = 25
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 25 / 2 = <<25/2=12.5>>12.5, rounding to the nearest whole number, x = <<round(12.5)=13>>13
Therefore, Emily will be 13 years old when John is 3 times her age.

2x + 6 = 42
2x = 42 - 6
2x = <<42-6=36>>36
x = 36 / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18

"Abigail is 12 years younger than her brother Benjamin. In 8 years, Benjamin will be twice as old as Abigail. How old will Abigail and Benjamin be in 5 years?","Let's call Abigail's current age 'A'. Benjamin is 12 years older than Abigail, so his current age is A + 12.
In 8 years, Abigail will be A + 8, and Benjamin will be A + 12 + 8 = A + 20.
We know that in 8 years, Benjamin will be twice Abigail's age. So, A + 20 = 2(A + 8)
A + 20 = 2A + 16
20 = A + 16
A = <<20-16=4>>4
So, Abigail is currently 4 years old, and Benjamin is 4 + 12 = <<4+12=16>>16 years old.

x + 20 = 2x + 16
20 = x + 16
x = <<20-16=4>>4
So, Sarah is 4 years old now.

2032 - 2012 = <<2032-2012=20>>20 years
There are 5 sets of 4-year periods in 20 years since 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5.
If Emily is 22 in 2032, she would have been born in 2032 - 22 = <<2032-22=2010>>2010.
In 2012, Emily would have been 2012 - 2010 = <<2012-2010=2>>2 years old.
Since Jake was 16 when Emily was 2, he is 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years older than her.

Emma is 12 years younger than that, so Emma is currently 21 - 12 = <<21-12=9>>9 years old.
To determine when Emma will be half Sophia's age, let's call the number of years from now 'x'.
In 'x' years, Sophia will be 42 + x years old and Emma will be 9 + x years old.
If Emma is half Sophia's age then, we can write the equation:
9 + x = (42 + x) / 2
Solving for x:
9 + x = 21 + x/2
x/2 = 12
x = <<12*2=24>>24
Therefore, in 24 years, Emma will be exactly half the age of her mother Sophia.

(x + 5) + (x + 13) = 58
2x + 18 = 58
2x = 58 - 18 = <<58-18=40>>40
x = 40 / 2 = <<40/2=20>>20
So Helen is 20 years old now.
In 10 years, Helen will be 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 years old.

"In 2020, Liam was 36 years old and his son Noah was 9 years old. Assuming Liam is always 4 times as old as Noah, in which year will Liam be twice as old as Noah?","Let's first calculate how old Noah will be when Liam is twice his age.
If Liam is 2x years old, then Noah would be x years old.
Since Liam is always 4 times as old as Noah, we can set up the equation:
2x = 4x
2x = 4(x)
2x = <<4*x=4x>>4x
Solving for x:
2x / 2 = 4x / 2
x = <<4x/2=2x>>2x
So when Noah is 2x years old, Liam will be twice his age.
In 2020, Noah was 9 years old. To determine how many years it will take for Noah to be 2x years old, we calculate:
2x - 9 = 2(9) - 9
2x - 9 = <<2*9-9=9>>9 years
So it will take 9 years from 2020 for Noah to be 2x years old and Liam to be twice his age.

So Katie is currently 14 years old.
In 10 years, Katie will be 14 + 10 = <<14+10=24>>24 years old.
In 10 years, Katie's grandmother will be 84 + 10 = <<84+10=94>>94 years old.
To determine how many times older Katie's grandmother will be than Katie in 10 years, we divide the grandmother's age by Katie's age:

x + y = 44
Substituting the first equation into the second:
x + (x + 12) = 44
Simplifying:

2x = 44 - 12
2x = <<44-12=32>>32
x = 32/2 = <<32/2=16>>16
So Liam's current age is 16, and Olivia's current age is 16 + 12 = <<16+12=28>>28.

30 + x = 10 + 2x
30 - 10 = 2x - x
20 = x
So, 20 years after 2010, Bob's age will be twice Tim's age.

In 2030, Emma will be 15 + 8 = <<15+8=23>>23 years old.
Liam's father Oliver is 45 + 25 = <<45+25=70>>70 years old in 2022.
To find the year when Oliver was twice Emma's age in 2030, we calculate:
Oliver's age: x
Emma's age in 2030: 23
x = 2 * 23 = <<2*23=46>>46
This means Oliver was 46 years old when he was twice Emma's age in 2030.
To find the year, we take Oliver's age in 2022 (70) and subtract the age he was when twice Emma's 2030 age (46):  
70 - 46 = <<70-46=24>>24
So 24 years before 2022, in the year 2022 - 24 = <<2022-24=1998>>1998, Oliver was twice as old as Emma will be in 2030.

"In 1995, Susie was 3 times as old as her son Doug. In 2025, Doug will be 5 years younger than half Susie's age. How old was Susie in 1995?","Let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let x be Doug's age in 1995.
In 1995, Susie was 3x years old.
In 2025, Doug will be x + 30 years old (since 2025 is 30 years after 1995).
In 2025, Susie will be 3x + 30 years old.
We know that in 2025, Doug will be 5 years younger than half Susie's age.
Equation: x + 30 = (3x + 30)/2 - 5
Solve the equation:
x + 30 = 1.5x + 15 - 5
x + 30 = 1.5x + 10
30 = 0.5x + 10
20 = 0.5x
x = 20/0.5 = <<20/0.5=40>>40
So in 1995, Doug was 40 years old and Susie was 3 * 40 = <<3*40=120>>120 years old.

Since Lucas is twice Olivia's age, Lucas is 7 * 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 years old.
We can check that the sum of their current ages is indeed 41: 12 + 7 + 14 = <<12+7+14=33>>33.
In 7 years, Evan will be 12 + 7 = <<12+7=19>>19 years old.
In 7 years, Olivia will be 7 + 7 = <<7+7=14>>14 years old.

How old was Gina when Lily was born, and how old will Lily be on Gina's 50th birthday?","To find out how old Gina was when Lily was born, we subtract Lily's current age from Gina's current age.
Gina's age when Lily was born = 28 - 7 = <<28-7=21>>21 years old.
To calculate Lily's age when Gina turns 50, we first find the number of years until Gina's 50th birthday.
Years until Gina turns 50 = 50 - 28 = <<50-28=22>>22 years.
Since Lily is 7 now, we add 22 years to her current age.
Lily's age when Gina turns 50 = 7 + 22 = <<7+22=29>>29 years old.
Therefore, Gina was 21 when Lily was born, and Lily will be 29 on Gina's 50th birthday.

We know that the sum of their current ages is 44. So, x + (x - 12) = 44.
Simplifying, 2x - 12 = 44
2x = 56
x = <<56/2=28>>28
So, Emily's current age is 28.
In 5 years, Emily will be 28 + 5 = <<28+5=33>>33 years old.

In another 4 years, Sophia will be 7 + 4 = <<7+4=11>>11 years old, and Maya will be 32 + 4 = <<32+4=36>>36 years old.
When Maya is 36, she will be 36 / 11 = <<36/11=3.27272727273>>3 times Sophia's age, which is more than twice her age.
So we need to go back 1 year. Maya will be 36 - 1 = <<36-1=35>>35 and Sophia will be 11 - 1 = <<11-1=10>>10.

Assuming all friends were alive in 2020, what was the average age of the five friends in 2020?","Since Hannah was the youngest in 1990, we can assume that the other four friends were all older than 25 in 1990. 
From 1990 to 2020, 30 years have passed.
In 2020, Hannah is 48 years old, so in 1990 she was 48 - 30 = <<48-30=18>>18 years old.
If the average age was 25 in 1990, and Hannah was 18, the sum of the other four friends' ages would be:
25 * 5 - 18 = <<25*5-18=107>>107 years
The average age of the other four friends in 1990 was 107 / 4 = <<107/4=26.75>>26.75, rounded to <<round(26.75,0)=27>>27 years old.
So in 2020, the other four friends would be 27 + 30 = <<27+30=57>>57 years old on average.
The average of 48 (Hannah's age) and 57 * 4 (other friends' ages) is:

In how many years will Grandma Lily's age be twice the combined ages of Mia and Sophia?","First, let's calculate Grandma Lily's current age. Since she is 27 years older than Mia, her age is 36 + 27 = <<36+27=63>>63 years old.
Let's assume it takes x years for Grandma Lily's age to be twice the combined ages of Mia and Sophia.
After x years, Mia will be 36 + x years old, Sophia will be 9 + x years old, and Grandma Lily will be 63 + x years old.
The equation can be written as: 63 + x = 2(36 + x + 9 + x)
Simplifying the right side: 63 + x = 2(45 + 2x)
63 + x = 90 + 4x
x = 90 - 63 + 4x - 4x
x = <<90-63=27>>27 / 3
x = <<27/3=9>>9
Therefore, in 9 years, Grandma Lily's age will be twice the combined ages of Mia and Sophia.

We know that in 1995, Maria was 3 times as old as Sophie. So, m = 3s.
From 1995 to 2005, 10 years have passed. So in 2005, Maria was m+10 and Sophie was s+10.
We know the sum of their ages in 2005 was 50. So, (m+10) + (s+10) = 50.
Substitute m = 3s into the equation: (3s+10) + (s+10) = 50

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4s = 30
Divide both sides by 4: s = <<30/4=7.5>>8 (rounded to the nearest whole number)
So, Sophie was 8 in 1995. To find her age in 2025, we add 30 years (1995 to 2025).

We know that Derek is 12 years older than Samantha, so d = s + 12.
When Samantha was 9, Derek was 9 + 12 = <<9+12=21>>21.
At that time, their father was 41. So 21 years ago, their father was 41 - 21 = <<41-21=20>>20.

Since Noah is 12 years younger than Lucas, we can say L = N + 12.
When Noah was born, Olivia was 27, so now O = 27 + N.
We want to find out in how many years (let's call it Y) Olivia will be twice Noah's age:
O + Y = 2 * (N + Y)
Substituting the values:
27 + N + Y = 2N + 2Y
27 + Y = N + 2Y
27 = N + Y
Since O = 27 + N, we can substitute 27 = O - N:
O - N = N + Y
O = 2N + Y
O = 2N + (O - 2N)
O = O
This equation is always true, so we need more information to solve the problem.
Let's assume Lucas is currently 18 years old.
Then, L = 18, N = 18 - 12 = <<18-12=6>>6, and O = 27 + 6 = <<27+6=33>>33.
Now, we can solve for Y:
33 + Y = 2 * (6 + Y)
33 + Y = 12 + 2Y
33 - 12 = 2Y - Y
<<33-12=21>>21 = Y
Therefore, in 21 years, Olivia will be twice as old as Noah.

Four years ago, James was x - 4 years old, and Sarah was x + 12 - 4 = x + 8 years old.
We know that 4 years ago, Sarah was twice as old as James. So, x + 8 = 2(x - 4)
x + 8 = 2x - 8
8 = x - 8
x = <<8+8=16>>16

"Liam is 12 years younger than his sister Sophie. When Liam was 5, their father John was 38 years old. If Sophie is now twice as old as Liam, how old will John be in 7 years?","Let's start by finding Sophie's current age. We know that Sophie is currently twice Liam's age, and Liam is 12 years younger than Sophie. So if we call Sophie's current age x, then:
x - 12 = x/2
Solving for x:
x - 12 = x/2
2x - 24 = x
x = <<24=24>>24
So Sophie is currently 24 years old, and Liam is 24 - 12 = <<24-12=12>>12.
Now, we need to find how old Liam was 7 years ago. He would have been 12 - 7 = <<12-7=5>>5 years old.
At that time, John was 38. So now, 7 years later, John is 38 + 7 = <<38+7=45>>45 years old.
In 7 more years, John will be 45 + 7 = <<45+7=52>>52 years old.

In x years, Grandpa Jim will be 96 + x years old.
In x years, Ralph will be 32 + x years old and Lily will be 4 + x years old.
Their combined ages in x years will be (32 + x) + (4 + x) = 36 + 2x years old.
Grandpa Jim's age will be twice their combined age when:
96 + x = 2(36 + 2x)
96 + x = 72 + 4x
96 - 72 = 4x - x
24 = 3x
x = 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8
Therefore, in 8 years, Grandpa Jim's age will be twice the combined age of Ralph and Lily.

Grandma Hazel is 24 + 42 = <<24+42=66>>66 years old.
Let's say in n years, Grandma Hazel's age will be twice the combined age of Evelyn and Scarlett.
This can be expressed as: 66 + n = 2(24 + n + 6 + n)
Simplifying: 66 + n = 2(30 + 2n)
            66 + n = 60 + 4n
            6 + n = 4n
            6 = 3n

"Ralph is 12 years younger than his sister Tina. The sum of their current ages is 40. If their father Jack is 30 years older than Ralph, how old will Jack be in 15 years?","Let's say Tina's current age is x. Then, Ralph's current age would be x - 12.
We know that the sum of their current ages is 40. So, x + (x - 12) = 40
Simplifying, 2x - 12 = 40
2x = 52
x = <<52/2=26>>26
So, Tina is currently 26 years old and Ralph is 26 - 12 = <<26-12=14>>14 years old.
We are told that their father Jack is 30 years older than Ralph. So, Jack's current age is 14 + 30 = <<14+30=44>>44 years old.
In 15 years, Jack will be 44 + 15 = <<44+15=59>>59 years old.

"Emily is 12 years old and her brother Jack is 5 years younger than her. Their cousin Sophie is twice as old as Jack. If the sum of their ages is 41 now, how old will Emily be in 7 years?","Let's start by finding Jack's age. Since he is 5 years younger than Emily, Jack is 12 - 5 = <<12-5=7>>7 years old.
Sophie is twice as old as Jack, so Sophie is 7 * 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 years old.
The sum of their ages now is 12 + 7 + 14 = <<12+7+14=33>>33.
But the question states the sum of their ages is 41 now. Since Emily is the oldest, let's assume her current age was incorrect.
41 - 7 - 14 = <<41-7-14=20>>20, so Emily must be 20 years old now.
In 7 years, Emily will be 20 + 7 = <<20+7=27>>27 years old.

"Zoe is 12 years younger than her brother Luke. In 8 years, Luke will be twice as old as Zoe. How old will Zoe be in 5 years?","Let's say Zoe is currently x years old. Since she is 12 years younger than Luke, Luke is currently x + 12 years old.
In 8 years, Zoe will be x + 8 years old, and Luke will be x + 12 + 8 = x + 20 years old.
We know that in 8 years, Luke will be twice Zoe's age, so:
x + 20 = 2(x + 8)
x + 20 = 2x + 16
20 = x + 16
x = <<20-16=4>>4
So Zoe is currently 4 years old.
In 5 years, Zoe will be 4 + 5 = <<4+5=9>>9 years old.
