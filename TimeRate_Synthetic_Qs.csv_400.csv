"A toy car is traveling on a train track at a speed of 5 feet per second. It takes the toy car 12 seconds to complete one loop around the track. A toy airplane is flying in circles above the track at a speed of 10 feet per second. It takes the airplane 8 seconds to complete one loop in the air. After 2 minutes, how many more feet has the airplane traveled compared to the toy car?","The toy car travels at 5 feet per second, so in one loop it goes 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 feet.
In 2 minutes (120 seconds), the toy car completes 120 / 12 = <<120/12=10>>10 loops.
The total distance the toy car travels is 10 * 60 = <<10*60=600>>600 feet.
The toy airplane travels at 10 feet per second, so in one loop it goes 10 * 8 = <<10*8=80>>80 feet. 
In 2 minutes (120 seconds), the toy airplane completes 120 / 8 = <<120/8=15>>15 loops.
The total distance the toy airplane travels is 15 * 80 = <<15*80=1200>>1200 feet.
The airplane traveled 1200 - 600 = <<1200-600=600>>600 feet more than the toy car.

"A construction crew is paving a road that will be 12 miles long. They have already completed 4 miles of the road, and at their current pace, they can pave 2 miles per day. The crew works 5 days a week. How many weeks will it take for them to finish paving the entire road?","The road is 12 miles long, and the crew has already paved 4 miles. This means they have 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 miles left to pave.
The crew can pave 2 miles per day, and they work 5 days a week. This means they can pave 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 miles per week.
To calculate the number of weeks needed to pave the remaining 8 miles, we divide 8 by 10 miles per week: 8 / 10 = <<8/10=0.8>>0.8 weeks.
Since the crew can only work in full weeks, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take the crew <<round(0.8)=1>>1 week to finish paving the entire road.

Starting from the bottom of the well on day 1, how many days will it take for the snail to climb out of the well?","On day 1, the snail climbs up 4 feet and slides back 2 feet, gaining 4 - 2 = <<4-2=2>>2 feet. It ends the day 2 feet up the well.
On day 2, the snail climbs up another 4 feet to 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 feet, then slides back 2 feet to 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4 feet up the well.
On day 3, the snail climbs up 4 feet to 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8 feet, then slides back to 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 feet up the well.
On day 4, the snail climbs up 4 feet to 6 + 4 = <<6+4=10>>10 feet, then slides back to 10 - 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 feet up the well.
On day 5, the snail climbs up 4 feet to 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 feet, then slides back to 12 - 2 = <<12-2=10>>10 feet up the well.
On day 6, the snail climbs up 4 feet to 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 feet, then slides back to 14 - 2 = <<14-2=12>>12 feet up the well.
On day 7, the snail climbs up 4 feet to 12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 feet, then slides back to 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 feet up the well.
On day 8, the snail climbs up 4 feet to 14 + 4 = <<14+4=18>>18 feet, then slides back to 18 - 2 = <<18-2=16>>16 feet up the well.
On day 9, the snail climbs the remaining 4 feet and reaches the top of the well.
Therefore, it will take the snail 9 days to climb out of the 20-foot well.

"A factory produces widgets at a rate of 120 per hour. The factory runs for 8 hours per day, 5 days per week. Due to high demand, the factory increases its production rate by 20% and adds an extra 2 hours to each workday. How many additional widgets will the factory produce in a week at the new rate and schedule compared to the old one?","Initially, the factory produces 120 widgets per hour * 8 hours per day * 5 days per week = 120 * 8 * 5 = <<120*8*5=4800>>4800 widgets per week.
With the 20% increase, the new production rate is 120 + (120 * 0.20) = 120 + 24 = <<120+24=144>>144 widgets per hour.
The new schedule is 10 hours per day, 5 days per week.
At the new rate and schedule, the factory produces 144 widgets per hour * 10 hours per day * 5 days per week = 144 * 10 * 5 = <<144*10*5=7200>>7200 widgets per week.
The difference in weekly production is 7200 - 4800 = <<7200-4800=2400>>2400 additional widgets per week.

"A turtle and a rabbit decide to race from one end of a park to the other. The park is 1 mile long. The turtle travels at a steady speed of 1/4 mile per hour, while the rabbit moves at 1/2 mile per hour but takes a 1 hour nap halfway through the race. How many hours will it take for the turtle to finish the race?","To find the turtle's time, we divide the total distance by its speed:
1 mile ÷ (1/4 mile per hour) = <<1/(1/4)=4>>4 hours for the turtle to finish the race.

The rabbit travels half the distance in:
(1/2 mile) ÷ (1/2 mile per hour) = <<(1/2)/(1/2)=1>>1 hour.
It then naps for 1 hour and finishes the remaining 1/2 mile in another 1 hour.
So the rabbit finishes in 1 + 1 + 1 = <<1+1+1=3>>3 hours.

Therefore, it will take the turtle 4 hours to finish the 1 mile race.

What is the total distance traveled by the boat, in miles?","Let's call the distance the boat travels downstream and upstream d.
Downstream: The boat's speed is 10 miles per hour, so d / 10 = <<d/10=0.5d>>0.5d hours to travel downstream.
Upstream: The boat's speed is 4 miles per hour, and it takes 2 hours. So, d / 4 = <<d/4=2>>2 hours.
We can set up an equation: 0.5d + 2 = 2.5d. Solving for d:
2 = 2.5d - 0.5d
2 = <<2.5-0.5=2>>2d
d = <<2/2=1>>1
The distance traveled downstream is d = 1. So the total distance is 2 * d = 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 miles.

"A water tank fills at a rate of 5 gallons per minute. It takes 12 minutes to fill a second tank that is 3 times the size of the first tank. If both tanks are filled simultaneously, how many gallons of water will be in both tanks after 9 minutes?","The first tank fills at a rate of 5 gallons per minute. After 9 minutes it will contain 5 * 9 = <<5*9=45>>45 gallons.
The second tank is 3 times the size of the first tank. The first tank has a capacity of 5 gallons per minute * 12 minutes = <<5*12=60>>60 gallons. 
So the second tank has a capacity of 60 * 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 gallons.
The second tank fills in 12 minutes, so its fill rate is 180 gallons / 12 minutes = <<180/12=15>>15 gallons per minute.
After 9 minutes the second tank will contain 15 * 9 = <<15*9=135>>135 gallons.
Therefore, after 9 minutes the total amount of water in both tanks will be 45 + 135 = <<45+135=180>>180 gallons.

The ship then makes a return trip from Port B to Port A, but this time it increases its speed by 5 miles per hour. How many fewer hours will the return trip take compared to the initial trip?","The initial trip takes 2 days, and each day the ship travels 20 miles per hour for 12 hours. So the total distance is:
20 miles per hour * 12 hours per day * 2 days = <<20*12*2=480>>480 miles
For the return trip, the ship's speed is increased by 5 miles per hour to 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 miles per hour.
To calculate the time taken for the return trip:
480 miles / 25 miles per hour = <<480/25=19.2>>19.2 hours, rounded to <<round(19.2)=19>>19 hours.
The initial trip took 12 hours per day * 2 days = <<12*2=24>>24 hours.

After 5 laps, the car will have traveled for 5*15 = <<5*15=75>>75 seconds.
So, it will take between 4 and 5 laps for the car to catch up. We can calculate the exact time:
Let x be the number of seconds for the car to catch up. Then:

With the breakdown, the machine produces:
120 widgets per hour * 3 hours = <<120*3=360>>360 widgets, plus
60 widgets per hour * 2 hours = <<60*2=120>>120 widgets during the repair, plus 
120 widgets per hour * 3 hours = <<120*3=360>>360 widgets after the repair.
In total, that's 360 + 120 + 360 = <<360+120+360=840>>840 widgets.
So the breakdown caused the factory to produce 960 - 840 = <<960-840=120>>120 fewer widgets.

"A factory machine produces widgets at a rate of 120 per hour. After 2 hours of operation, the machine's speed is increased to 150 widgets per hour for the next 3 hours. Finally, the machine's speed is reduced to 100 widgets per hour for the last hour of operation. How many total widgets did the machine produce in the 6-hour period?","In the first 2 hours, the machine produced 120 widgets per hour * 2 hours = <<120*2=240>>240 widgets.
For the next 3 hours, the machine produced 150 widgets per hour * 3 hours = <<150*3=450>>450 widgets.
In the final hour, the machine produced 100 widgets per hour * 1 hour = <<100*1=100>>100 widgets.
So, the total number of widgets produced in the 6-hour period is 240 + 450 + 100 = <<240+450+100=790>>790 widgets.

"A train travels at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour. It takes the train 3 hours to get from City A to City B. On the return trip from City B to City A, the train's speed is reduced by 10 miles per hour due to track maintenance. How much longer does the return trip take compared to the initial trip, in minutes?","The initial trip takes 3 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour, so the distance between City A and City B is 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 miles.
On the return trip, the train's speed is reduced to 50 - 10 = <<50-10=40>>40 miles per hour.
To calculate the time for the return trip, we divide the distance by the speed: 150 miles / 40 miles per hour = <<150/40=3.75>>3.75 hours.
3.75 hours is equal to 3 hours and 0.75 * 60 = <<0.75*60=45>>45 minutes.
The return trip takes 3 hours and 45 minutes, which is 45 minutes longer than the initial trip.

"A baker is making a large cake for a wedding. He needs to make enough frosting to cover the cake. The recipe for the frosting requires 2 cups of sugar for every 3 cups of butter. If the baker has already used 9 cups of butter, how many more cups of sugar does he need to finish the frosting?","The recipe requires 2 cups of sugar for every 3 cups of butter.
Since the baker used 9 cups of butter, he will need (9/3) * 2 = <<(9/3)*2=6>>6 cups of sugar to maintain the ratio.
Assuming he already had some sugar, the question is asking how many more cups he needs.
To determine this, we would need to know how much sugar he has already used.
Without this information, we cannot calculate how many additional cups of sugar the baker needs.
