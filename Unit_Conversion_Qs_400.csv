"A baker uses 2.5 cups of flour to make a loaf of bread. If he has 37.5 cups of flour, how many full loaves can he make, and how many cups of flour will be left over?","To determine the number of loaves, we divide the total cups of flour by the cups needed per loaf:
37.5 cups / 2.5 cups per loaf = <<37.5/2.5=15>>15 loaves
To calculate the leftover flour, we multiply the number of loaves by the cups of flour per loaf and subtract from the total:
37.5 cups - (15 loaves * 2.5 cups per loaf) = <<37.5-(15*2.5)=0>>0 cups left over
So the baker can make 15 full loaves with no flour left over.

"A factory produces 150 smartphones per hour. Each smartphone requires 12 different components to assemble. If the factory operates for 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, how many total components are needed to maintain full production for 3 weeks?","The factory produces 150 smartphones per hour, and operates 8 hours per day.
So, the daily smartphone production is 150 * 8 = <<150*8=1200>>1200 smartphones.
The factory operates 5 days per week, so the weekly smartphone production is 1200 * 5 = <<1200*5=6000>>6000 smartphones.
Over 3 weeks, the total smartphone production will be 6000 * 3 = <<6000*3=18000>>18000 smartphones.
Each smartphone requires 12 components.
So, the total number of components needed for 3 weeks of production is 18000 * 12 = <<18000*12=216000>>216000 components.

"A bakery uses 2.5 cups of flour to make a batch of 18 cookies. If a cup of flour weighs 4.25 ounces, how many pounds of flour does the bakery need to make 540 cookies?","To make 18 cookies, the bakery needs 2.5 cups of flour.
To determine the number of batches needed for 540 cookies: 540 cookies / 18 cookies per batch = <<540/18=30>>30 batches.
For 30 batches, the bakery needs 30 * 2.5 = <<30*2.5=75>>75 cups of flour.
One cup of flour weighs 4.25 ounces, so 75 cups weigh 75 * 4.25 = <<75*4.25=318.75>>318.75 ounces.
To convert ounces to pounds, divide by 16 since 1 pound = 16 ounces.

However, she wants to walk for 3 minutes after every 2 miles that she runs. If she walks at a pace of 3.5 miles per hour, how long will it take her to complete the marathon?","The total distance of the marathon is 26.2 miles.
Alicia will run 2 miles, then walk for 3 minutes. This pattern will repeat.
26.2 miles / 2 miles per segment = <<26.2/2=13.1>>13 segments (rounded down since the last segment will be shorter)
13 segments * 3 minutes of walking = <<13*3=39>>39 minutes of total walking time
39 minutes = 39/60 = <<39/60=0.65>>0.65 hours
Running time:
Alicia runs at 6 miles per hour
26.2 miles - (0.65 hours * 3.5 miles/hour) = <<26.2-(0.65*3.5)=23.925>>23.925 miles left to run
23.925 miles / 6 miles per hour = <<23.925/6=3.9875>>3.9875 hours of running
Total time:
0.65 hours walking + 3.9875 hours running = <<0.65+3.9875=4.6375>>4.6375 hours

"Peter's father gave him $300 for his birthday. Peter wants to buy a video game console that costs $420. He already has $50 saved up from before. If Peter earns $15 per day from his part-time job, how many days will it take him to save enough money to buy the video game console?","The video game console costs $420.
Peter already has $50 saved up and his father gave him $300 for his birthday.
So he currently has $50 + $300 = $<<50+300=350>>350.
He still needs $420 - $350 = $<<420-350=70>>70 to buy the video game console.

"A family is planning a road trip from Seattle to Los Angeles, which is approximately 1,135 miles. Their car can travel an average of 30 miles per gallon of gas. If the average price of gas is $3.50 per gallon, and they have a budget of $200 for gas, how many miles will they need to make up by taking cheaper transportation like buses or trains?","First, we calculate how many gallons of gas the family can buy with their $200 budget.
$200 / $3.50 per gallon = <<200/3.5=57.14285714285714>>57 gallons (rounded down to stay within budget)
Next, we determine how many miles they can travel with 57 gallons of gas.
57 gallons * 30 miles per gallon = <<57*30=1710>>1,710 miles
To find out how many miles they'll need to make up with cheaper transportation, we subtract the miles they can travel by car from the total trip distance.
1,135 miles - 1,710 miles = <<1135-1710=-575>>-575 miles
Since the result is negative, it means they can complete the entire trip within their budget and won't need to use cheaper transportation.

"A farm has 120 animals consisting of chickens and cows. Each chicken consumes 5 pounds of feed per week, while each cow needs 40 pounds of feed per week. The farm uses a total of 3100 pounds of feed every week. How many cows are there on the farm?","Let the number of cows be represented by x.
Since the total number of animals is 120 and x represents the number of cows, the number of chickens would be 120 - x.
Each chicken consumes 5 pounds of feed per week, so the amount of feed consumed by chickens is 5(120 - x) = <<5*(120-x)=600-5*x>>600 - 5x pounds.
Each cow consumes 40 pounds of feed per week, so the amount of feed consumed by cows is 40x pounds.
The total feed consumed is 3100 pounds.
Therefore, 600 - 5x + 40x = 3100
35x = <<3100-600=2500>>2500

One cubic yard of concrete covers 27 square feet at a 6-inch depth. Concrete costs $98 per cubic yard. How much will the concrete cost for this project?,"First, we need to calculate the area of the slab in square feet. The slab is 20 feet wide and 30 feet long, so the area is 20 * 30 = <<20*30=600>>600 square feet.
We know that one cubic yard of concrete covers 27 square feet at a 6-inch depth. To find out how many cubic yards we need, we divide the total square footage by 27.
600 square feet / 27 square feet per cubic yard = <<600/27=22.2222>>22.2222 cubic yards. We round this up to <<23>>23 cubic yards to ensure we have enough concrete.

We know the company has a total budget of $1200. 
Each deluxe lunch costs $24 and each basic lunch costs $18.
To maximize the number of deluxe lunches while staying in budget, we should see how many deluxe lunches we can afford first.
$1200 / $24 per deluxe lunch = <<1200/24=50>>50 deluxe lunches
So if they got 50 deluxe lunches it would cost 50 * $24 = $<<50*24=1200>>1200, using up the entire budget.
But if they got 49 deluxe lunches instead, it would cost 49 * $24 = $<<49*24=1176>>1176, leaving $1200 - $1176 = $<<1200-1176=24>>24 for basic lunches.
With the remaining $24, they could afford $24 / $18 per basic lunch = <<24/18=1.33333333333>>1 basic lunch. (Rounded down since partial lunches aren't possible)

If they want to give each employee a gift card worth $25, how many employees will receive a gift card? Additionally, if they decide to increase the value of each gift card by 20%, how many fewer employees will receive a gift card while staying within the same budget?","With a budget of $12,500 and each gift card worth $25, the company can give out 12,500 / 25 = <<12500/25=500>>500 gift cards.
If they increase the value of each gift card by 20%, the new value will be $25 * 1.20 = $<<25*1.20=30>>30 per card.
With the same budget of $12,500, they can now give out 12,500 / 30 = <<12500/30=416.67>>417 gift cards (rounded to the nearest whole number).
The difference in the number of employees receiving a gift card is 500 - 417 = <<500-417=83>>83.
Therefore, if the company increases the gift card value by 20%, 83 fewer employees will receive a gift card.

"A factory produces 120 shirts per hour. Each shirt requires 2 meters of fabric. The fabric is sold in rolls of 50 meters each. If the factory runs for 8 hours a day, how many whole rolls of fabric will be used per day?","The factory produces 120 shirts per hour, and runs for 8 hours per day. So, the total shirts produced per day is 120 * 8 = <<120*8=960>>960 shirts.
Each shirt requires 2 meters of fabric. So, for 960 shirts, the total fabric needed is 960 * 2 = <<960*2=1920>>1920 meters.
The fabric is sold in rolls of 50 meters each. To find the number of whole rolls needed, we divide 1920 by 50: 1920 / 50 = <<1920/50=38.4>>38.4.
Since we can only use whole rolls, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is <<round(38.4)=38>>38.

The number of trips needed is 2,400 tons / 25 tons per trip = <<2400/25=96>>96 trips.
Since there are 6 trucks, the number of trips per truck is 96 trips / 6 trucks = <<96/6=16>>16 trips per truck.
The distance from the gravel pit to the construction site is 30 miles one way, so a round trip is 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 miles.
At an average speed of 40 miles per hour, the driving time for each round trip is 60 miles / 40 miles per hour = <<60/40=1.5>>1.5 hours or 1 hour 30 minutes.
Each trip also includes 30 minutes to load and 30 minutes to unload, adding 30 + 30 = <<30+30=60>>60 minutes, or 1 hour, to each trip.
Therefore, the total time per trip is 1.5 hours driving + 1 hour loading/unloading = <<1.5+1=2.5>>2.5 hours.
Since each truck needs to make 16 trips, the total time per truck is 16 trips * 2.5 hours per trip = <<16*2.5=40>>40 hours.
As all 6 trucks can work simultaneously, the total time to transport all the gravel will be 40 hours.

Let's assume they make x burritos. This means they will make 2x tacos.
Each burrito uses 6 ounces, so x burritos will use 6x ounces.
Each taco uses 4 ounces, so 2x tacos will use 4 * 2x = <<4*2=8>>8x ounces.
The total meat used is 6x + 8x = <<6+8=14>>14x ounces, which should be less than or equal to 240 ounces.

"A train travels at an average speed of 120 kilometers per hour. It makes 4 stops along the way, each lasting 12 minutes. If the total distance of the journey is 840 kilometers, how long will the entire trip take in hours?","The train's speed is 120 km/h, and the total distance is 840 km. Without stops, the journey would take 840 km / 120 km/h = <<840/120=7>>7 hours.
However, the train makes 4 stops, each lasting 12 minutes. We need to convert the total stop time from minutes to hours.
Total stop time = 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 minutes
48 minutes = <<48/60=0.8>>0.8 hours (48 minutes / 60 minutes per hour)
So, the total journey time is:
Travel time + Stop time = 7 hours + 0.8 hours = <<7+0.8=7.8>>7.8 hours
Rounded to the nearest whole number, the entire trip will take <<round(7.8)=8>>8 hours.

The sum of a geometric series is: S = a(1-r^n)/(1-r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.
Here, a = x, r = 1.1, and n = 20.
500 = x(1-1.1^20)/(1-1.1)

3 cups peanuts / 6 cups mix = x cups peanuts / 30 cups mix
2 cups raisins / 6 cups mix = x cups raisins / 30 cups mix
1 cup chocolate chips / 6 cups mix = x cups chocolate chips / 30 cups mix
Solving for x in each equation:
Peanuts: 3/6 = x/30 --> x = (3*30)/6 = <<(3*30)/6=15>>15 cups 
Raisins: 2/6 = x/30 --> x = (2*30)/6 = <<(2*30)/6=10>>10 cups
Chocolate Chips: 1/6 = x/30 --> x = (1*30)/6 = <<(1*30)/6=5>>5 cups
Therefore, to make 30 cups of trail mix, Samantha will need 15 cups of peanuts, 10 cups of raisins, and 5 cups of chocolate chips.

So, the daily production is 150 * 16 = <<150*16=2400>>2400 smartphones.
Each smartphone requires 12 microchips, so the daily microchip requirement is 2400 * 12 = <<2400*12=28800>>28800 microchips.
With 50,000 microchips in inventory, the factory can continue production for 50,000 / 28800 = <<50000/28800=1>>1 day before running out of microchips.
Each smartphone also requires 8 sensors, so the daily sensor requirement is 2400 * 8 = <<2400*8=19200>>19200 sensors.
With 35,000 sensors in inventory, the factory can continue production for 35,000 / 19200 = <<35000/19200=1>>1 day before running out of sensors.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (20 + 15) = 2 * 35 = <<2*35=70>>70 feet
Now, we can calculate the total square footage of the walls by multiplying the perimeter by the height.
Wall area = Perimeter * Height = 70 * 10 = <<70*10=700>>700 square feet
Since one gallon of paint covers approximately 400 square feet, we need to divide the total wall area by 400 to determine the number of gallons needed.

"A construction company needs to transport 18,000 cubic yards of dirt in 30 days. Their dump trucks have a capacity of 12 cubic yards each and can make 5 trips per day. If the company has 6 dump trucks available, how many more dump trucks will they need to rent in order to complete the job on time?","First, let's calculate how many cubic yards can be transported by the 6 dump trucks in 30 days.
Each truck can carry 12 cubic yards and can make 5 trips per day.
So, each truck can transport 12 * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 cubic yards per day.
With 6 trucks, they can transport 60 * 6 = <<60*6=360>>360 cubic yards per day.
In 30 days, the 6 trucks can transport 360 * 30 = <<360*30=10800>>10,800 cubic yards.
They need to transport a total of 18,000 cubic yards.
So, they still need to transport 18,000 - 10,800 = <<18000-10800=7200>>7,200 cubic yards.
Each additional truck can transport 60 cubic yards per day for 30 days, which is 60 * 30 = <<60*30=1800>>1,800 cubic yards.
To calculate the number of additional trucks needed, we divide 7,200 by 1,800.
7,200 / 1,800 = <<7200/1800=4>>4
Therefore, they need to rent 4 more dump trucks to complete the job on time.

"Aiden's family is driving to visit his grandparents, who live 240 miles away. If they have already driven 135 miles and are traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, how many more minutes will it take them to reach their destination?","The total distance to Aiden's grandparents is 240 miles.
They have already driven 135 miles, so the remaining distance is 240 - 135 = <<240-135=105>>105 miles.
They are traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
To calculate the time in hours, we divide the distance by the speed: 105 miles / 60 miles per hour = <<105/60=1.75>>1.75 hours.
To convert 1.75 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 1.75 * 60 = <<1.75*60=105>>105 minutes.
It will take them approximately 105 minutes (or 1 hour and 45 minutes) to reach their destination.

To find the total number of posts needed, we calculate 120 / 3 = <<120/3=40>>40 posts.
The carpenter has already placed 12 posts, so the remaining number of posts to install is 40 - 12 = <<40-12=28>>28 posts.
Each post takes 10 minutes to install, so for 28 posts, it will take 28 * 10 = <<28*10=280>>280 minutes.
To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 280 minutes / 60 = <<280/60=4.67>>4.67 hours.

Distance covered at slower speed = 50 km/hr * 2 hours = <<50*2=100>>100 km
The remaining distance to be covered at normal speed is 450 km - 100 km = <<450-100=350>>350 km
Time taken to cover the remaining distance at normal speed = 350 km / 75 km/hr = <<350/75=4.67>>5 hours (rounded up)

Each 12-pack contains 12 * 12 oz = <<12*12=144>>144 oz of soda.
To determine how many 12 oz cans equal 140 oz, we calculate 140 oz / 12 oz per can = <<140/12=11.67>>11.67, which rounds up to <<round(11.67)=12>>12 cans.
Since cans are only sold in 12-packs, you would need to purchase 1 12-pack to get at least 140 oz of soda.
A 12-pack costs $4.99, while seven 20 oz bottles would cost 7 * $1.79 = $<<7*1.79=12.53>>12.53.

This means the project requires a total of 36 * 8 = <<36*8=288>>288 worker-days of labor.
To complete the project in 24 days, the total worker-days of labor remains the same at 288.
With the shortened timeline of 24 days, the number of workers needed is 288 worker-days / 24 days = <<288/24=12>>12 workers.
Since the original crew had 8 workers, the number of additional workers needed is 12 - 8 = <<12-8=4>>4 workers.

"A grocery store is having a sale on canned goods. Each can of corn costs $0.75, and each can of green beans costs $0.80. If Julia wants to buy a total of 24 cans and spend exactly $20, how many cans of each type should she purchase?","Let's define variables:
c = number of cans of corn
g = number of cans of green beans
We know the total number of cans is 24, so:
c + g = <<c+g=24>>24
We also know the total cost is $20, so:
0.75c + 0.80g = <<0.75c+0.80g=20>>20
Solving the first equation for g:
g = 24 - c
Substituting this into the second equation:
0.75c + 0.80(24 - c) = 20
0.75c + 19.20 - 0.80c = 20
0.75c - 0.80c = 20 - 19.20
-0.05c = 0.80
c = 0.80 / -0.05 = <<0.80/-0.05=-16>>-16
Since a negative number of cans doesn't make sense, we know Julia should buy 0 cans of corn.
Substituting c = 0 into the first equation:
0 + g = 24
g = <<24-0=24>>24
Therefore, Julia should buy 0 cans of corn and 24 cans of green beans.

"A recipe for chocolate chip cookies calls for 2 1/4 cups of flour to make 36 cookies. If Olivia wants to make 108 cookies for a bake sale, how many cups of flour will she need?","We know that 2 1/4 cups of flour makes 36 cookies.
To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 108 cookies, we can set up a proportion:
2 1/4 cups / 36 cookies = x cups / 108 cookies
Cross multiply: 36x = 2.25 * 108
Solve for x: x = (2.25 * 108) / 36
x = 243 / 36 = <<243/36=6.75>>6.75 cups
So, Olivia will need 6.75 cups of flour to make 108 cookies.

If they have 25 participants and each participant walks at an average speed of 5 minutes per lap, how many minutes will it take for the group to reach their 50-kilometer goal?","50 kilometers is equal to 50,000 meters, since 1 kilometer = 1,000 meters.
To calculate the number of laps needed: 50,000 meters / 400 meters per lap = <<50000/400=125>>125 laps.
Since there are 25 participants, each participant needs to walk 125 laps / 25 participants = <<125/25=5>>5 laps.
At a pace of 5 minutes per lap, each participant will take 5 laps * 5 minutes/lap = <<5*5=25>>25 minutes.
Therefore, it will take the group 25 minutes to collectively walk 50 kilometers.

"A construction company needs to pour a concrete slab that is 24 feet long, 16 feet wide, and 6 inches thick. The concrete mix they are using costs $108 per cubic yard. How much will it cost for the concrete needed to pour this slab?","First, we need to calculate the volume of the slab in cubic feet. The slab is 24 feet long, 16 feet wide, and 6 inches (0.5 feet) thick.
Volume = length * width * thickness
Volume = 24 feet * 16 feet * 0.5 feet = <<24*16*0.5=192>>192 cubic feet
Now, we need to convert cubic feet to cubic yards, as the concrete is priced per cubic yard. There are 27 cubic feet in 1 cubic yard.
Volume in cubic yards = 192 cubic feet Ã· 27 cubic feet per cubic yard = <<192/27=7.111111111111111>>7.11 cubic yards
We round this up to <<round(7.111111111111111)=8>>8 cubic yards to ensure we have enough concrete.
At a cost of $108 per cubic yard, the total cost will be:
Total cost = 8 cubic yards * $108 per cubic yard = $<<8*108=864>>864

$120 / $15 per 5 miles = <<120/15=8>>8 sets of 5 miles
8 sets of 5 miles = 8 * 5 miles = <<8*5=40>>40 miles traveled
With an additional $60, the passenger could travel:
$60 / $15 per 5 miles = <<60/15=4>>4 more sets of 5 miles
4 sets of 5 miles = 4 * 5 miles = <<4*5=20>>20 additional miles

48 kilograms = 48 * 1000 = <<48*1000=48000>>48000 grams

Each widget requires 12 grams of raw material, so with 48000 grams they can produce:

To calculate the leftover raw material:
8 batches * 500 widgets per batch = <<8*500=4000>>4000 widgets produced
4000 widgets * 12 grams per widget = <<4000*12=48000>>48000 grams used

"A bakery uses 7.5 pounds of flour to make 30 loaves of bread. The bakery packages the bread in boxes, with each box containing 12 loaves. If a grocery store places an order for 25 boxes of bread, how many pounds of flour will the bakery need to fulfill the order?","Each box contains 12 loaves of bread, so 25 boxes will contain 25 * 12 = <<25*12=300>>300 loaves.
The bakery uses 7.5 pounds of flour for every 30 loaves.
To find the amount of flour needed for 300 loaves, we set up the proportion:
7.5 pounds / 30 loaves = x pounds / 300 loaves
Cross multiply: 30x = 7.5 * 300
Solve for x: x = (7.5 * 300) / 30 = <<(7.5*300)/30=75>>75 pounds
The bakery will need 75 pounds of flour to fulfill the grocery store's order.

"A factory produces 120 cars per day. Each car requires 4 tires and 2 headlights. If the factory has 2400 tires and 600 headlights in stock, how many more days can they continue production before running out of either tires or headlights?","To determine how many more days the factory can continue production, we need to calculate the number of days they can produce with their current stock of tires and headlights, then find the smaller of the two values.

With 2400 tires, since each car needs 4 tires, they can produce:
2400 tires / 4 tires per car = <<2400/4=600>>600 cars

At a rate of 120 cars per day, this stock of tires will last:
600 cars / 120 cars per day = <<600/120=5>>5 days

With 600 headlights, since each car needs 2 headlights, they can produce:
600 headlights / 2 headlights per car = <<600/2=300>>300 cars

At a rate of 120 cars per day, this stock of headlights will last:
300 cars / 120 cars per day = <<300/120=2.5>>2.5 days, rounded down to <<floor(2.5)=2>>2 days

Therefore, the factory can continue production for 2 more days before running out of headlights, which will happen before they run out of tires.

The truck they will use can carry a maximum volume of 1728 cubic feet. Assuming they pack the boxes with maximum efficiency, how many trucks will they need to ship all the widgets?","Each box has a volume of 8 * 6 * 4 = <<8*6*4=192>>192 cubic inches.
7200 widgets will require 7200 / 12 = <<7200/12=600>>600 boxes.
600 boxes will have a total volume of 600 * 192 = <<600*192=115200>>115200 cubic inches.
Converting cubic inches to cubic feet: 115200 / 1728 = <<115200/1728=66.67>>67 cubic feet.

"A factory produces 120 bags of potato chips every 15 minutes. If each bag contains 40 grams of chips, how many kilograms of chips are produced in 2 hours?","There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 2 hours there are 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
Every 15 minutes, 120 bags are produced. So in 120 minutes, 120 / 15 = <<120/15=8>>8 times as many bags are produced.
8 * 120 = <<8*120=960>>960 bags are produced in 2 hours.
Each bag contains 40 grams, so in total 960 * 40 = <<960*40=38400>>38400 grams are produced.
There are 1000 grams in a kilogram, so 38400 / 1000 = <<38400/1000=38.4>>38.4 kilograms.
Rounding to the nearest whole number, <<round(38.4)=38>>38 kilograms of chips are produced in 2 hours.
